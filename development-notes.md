    - font-size: 100%;
            - using em's on some components like peek - for example in their header
            - h1 4em 
            -jq's need to understand over strategy in the em vs px 
                - I understand the difference - but when to use/ who uses what/

A.Frontpage 
    - Header/Hero
        - named: "header/hero in one light"
        - not exactly like peek's (hero image )
            - design html/css/js specifics 
            - I am using a background image size cover 
            - they are using img size 480 - but javascript plugin I believe handles the resizing
        - inote
            - hero image size (and possible oversizing), cropping, and image choice is a component in this working out.
            for different screen sizes. 
            - benefits section - - why .benefits-icon-div and not layout-align on its parent center center
                - but the vertical- align worked in the 
                <div flex-gt-sm="33">
                        <div layout="row" layout-sm="column" layout-padding layout`-align="center center">
            
         
### A.Front page
- 



###Services page or the Fresh Page 
    - Fresh speaks or is speaking to offerings and appraoch 
    - what is the story on this page and how do you say smartly
    
    story - at this point - as far as a with startup point of view
    
    Fresh is the theme - or the lead 
    - Headline - sums up the value of the service - or brand 
      - Supercharge your pics  
      (fresh - bc 
        - it is a different take or different value set
        - paradigm from other pic companies in the traditional sense)
        - incorporating a silicon valley or tech vibe to the concept - like bulletproofexec
    - intro summary to this headline
      





## Notes to get up

current version
- overall note seems to be missing some of that production value that i want, 
but need to think first on getting something to show.
- header peek logo -  like logo to start 
- front bigger and top pics or icons on the more section 
- 


another version
-main offerinfs
 - influencer pics
 - mettup 
 - custom 
 
 
 
##whats important at this stage?
- hava a cool - but simple look
 - I think 
    - connects a little better than the current 
    - I think admob does that a little more naturally 
    - so that is why i am making the switch 
    - most notably to the front page 
    


Design notes:
- wanted to do 4 boxes instead of 3 
    - but loses its power some 
    - more importantly - the smaller does allow for the proper headlines and size
