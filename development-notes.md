## Notes to get up

current version
- overall note seems to be missng some of that production value that i want, 
but need to think first on getting something to show.
- header peek logo -  like logo to start 
- front bigger and top pics or icons on the more section 
- 


another version
-main offerinfs
 - influencer pics
 - mettup 
 - custom 
 
 
 
##whats important at this stage?
- hava a cool - but simple look
 - I think 
    - connects a little better than the current 
    - I think admob does that a little more naturally 
    - so that is why i am making the switch 
    - most notably to the front page 
    


Design notes:
- wanted to do 4 boxes instead of 3 
    - but loses its power some 
    - more importantly - the smaller does allow for the proper headlines and size
