#objective 
    1. Uberpics mock and production
        - have good options for the mock up of upics 
        - important bc it gives more credence to the idea - when it looks
        out of silicon valley. 
    2. Components 
        - have components that are premade that I have for my tool belt.
    3. Flex-box 

# dev notes

- this is based on the google express website google.com/express
- they are specifically what they call gsx secondary banners 
- i am using it for gallery option - I think they will work well with the site
- this done in bootstrap - but the google express - shows that it seems to use flexbox


#ratios
- text area on the big is close to a 1/3 ratio 120 - 125 to 360

#features

- auto width transition 
- transition: width .3s ease-out .3s; is what is shown on google dev tools 



#other notes 
- added image container - they just have div


##google express
- parts
    - secondary banner  
    -  merchant-module (front-page) | category-module
        - my name for it - category module 
            - 3 versions 
                1- Product Grid - like 
                2- Front page version 
                3- Product Grid - like - but not full width images 
                    - like the movie section of the google express 
    -PAGES 
    - store - page
        - top categories container 
        - product grid 
            - product card     
    - category page
        - product grid 
        
##strategy 
- secondary banners 
    - could be used for most pop
    - or a general category gateway - special category. google uses Snack O'Clock
